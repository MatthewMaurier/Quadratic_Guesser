Quadratic Guesser generates a sample set of quadratics, trains a PyTorch regression model on them, and then guesses the abc coefficients of 
any quadratic if given it's y values along a 500 point linspace from -25 to 25

Generate dataset using TrainSetCreator.py, experiment with model using FeedForward.ipynb

github ignores the CSV files since they can be massive.
